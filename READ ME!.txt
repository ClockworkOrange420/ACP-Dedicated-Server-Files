I have included a semi fix for gore dupe!

These 3 files are located in the Data/Config folder and should only be installed if you are playing on a public server!

Private servers should not need this fix since the people playing should be trusted not to dupe!

This is a workaround fix that does not allow me to use the terrain shaped gore blocks and 
all corpses and gore blocks will be destroyed upon closing the loot window, any loot left inside the zombie body block will be dropped inside a backpack beside the gore block!

This is only a semi fix since the items that the zombie originally drops can still be duped however you can no longer dupe whatever you choose!

blocks.xml
entityclasses.xml
loot.xml

Replace these files with originals from the main mod if you wish to apply the gore dupe fix! 
If you do not want this gore dupe fix simply do not use these files and only use the original files I provided in the Main Mod!
